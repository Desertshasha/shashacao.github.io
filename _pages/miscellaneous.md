## Personal Interests

Outside of research, I am passionate about cultivating a healthy, balanced, and curious lifestyle.  

- **Running**: I am an enthusiastic runner and have completed marathons, which constantly remind me of the value of persistence and endurance.  

- **Yoga & Meditation**: I have been dedicated to yoga and meditation practice for over **seven years** (since 2018), usually on a 3â€“5 times per week basis. This long-term practice has become a core part of my daily life, helping me stay focused, resilient, and balanced.  

- **Hiking**: I love exploring nature through hiking, where I often find inspiration, reflection, and peace of mind away from daily routines.  

- **Reading**: I am an avid reader with broad interests, especially in social sciences, economics, philosophy, physics/complexity, biographies, and science fiction. Books are a way for me to connect ideas across disciplines and spark creativity in my research.
