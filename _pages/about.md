I am a Ph.D. Candidate in Information Systems at the W. P. Carey School of Business, Arizona State University, advised by Professor [Pei-yu Chen](https://search.asu.edu/profile/2217544) and [Raghu Santanam](https://search.asu.edu/profile/192381).

My research investigates how emerging technologies—such as **AI, Generative AI, digital platforms, and in-store technologies**—reshape consumer behavior, firm strategies, and societal outcomes. I focus on two major retail contexts:  
- **Traditional online and offline grocery retail**, including innovations such as **Home Delivery Services** and **Unmanned Systems**.  
- **Automobile industry**, examining the entire consumer journey from **online lead generation** (e.g., *Tiktok/Kuaishou livestreaming, Autohome advertising*) to **AI-driven invitations to stores** (e.g., *voice-based diagnostic systems*), to **in-store visits and consumer–sales consultant interactions** (increasingly supported by **LLM/GenAI systems**), and ultimately to **test drives and final purchases**.  

Methodologically, I leverage **econometric/statistical analyses (including structural models), field and lab experiments, and machine learning/deep learning (most recently, Large Language Models)** to design studies, analyze data, infer causality, and optimize managerial policies.   

Before my Ph.D., I studied at the **Research Centre on Fictitious Economy and Data Science, Chinese Academy of Sciences** and the **School of Economics and Management, University of Chinese Academy of Sciences**, where I cultivated interdisciplinary skills across economics, computer science, and data science. I also earned degrees in **Logistics Management** and **Law** from Zhengzhou University. These multidisciplinary experiences shaped my ability to integrate social science insights with computational rigor, laying the foundation for my IS research.
