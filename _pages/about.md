I am a Ph.D. Candidate in Information Systems at the W. P. Carey School of Business, Arizona State University.  
I am fortunate to be advised by [Professor Pei-yu Chen](https://search.asu.edu/profile/2217544) and [Professor Raghu Santanam](https://search.asu.edu/profile/192381).  

My research examines how emerging technologies—such as **AI, automation, and digital platforms**—reshape consumer behavior, firm strategies, and societal outcomes.  


Methodologically, I employ **econometric analysis, field experiments, machine learning, and text analysis** to provide causal evidence and managerial insights.  

Beyond research, I am deeply interested in how technology can create inclusive growth and positive societal impact.
